# cs333_MTG_Semantle

Names: Theo McGlashan, Robert Lanpher, Peter Dawson, Sebastian Heisler-Martin

This is a game similar to the popular word game semantle, but with Magic: the Gathering cards. Each day, a random magic card is chosen, and you must guess it. For each incorrect guess, the similarity between the cwrd you guessed and the correct card will be shown.

This game can be played through cloning the repo and running "python main.py" in a terminal, but it will require several python libraries.

It can also be run from this exe file:

Note: this game is very hard, even for experienced magic players who know a lot of cards.
